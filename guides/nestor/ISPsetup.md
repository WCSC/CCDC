## Prerequisites <a id="preinfo"></a>
1. Have [Network Adapter setup](link-to-guide)running
1. If you have not setup your network adapter look here https://goo.gl/vs4cHC.
2. Just copy the Prerequisites of peoples guides before yours here.
3. Have your [virtual environment](link-to-guide) configured
4. Have the [ISP](link-to-guide) gateway running.
5. Have [pfSense](link-to-guide) running.

## Summary <a id="Summary"></a>
The logical ideal of this tutorial is for you to be able to setup the ISP server for your lab. The ISP lab is the one that allow you to connect your other lab to the internet think at it as your internet provider at home.

| Network adapters | Description                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------        |

| Adapter 2        | Change to Host-only (WAN Environment)   |


## VirtualBox VM Setup <a id="First"></a>


1. Go to [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) and download the LTS server version. 

- Install Ubuntu Server in Virtual Machine
- On Virtual Box go to top left corner to `New` to create the virtual box.

![Section2](https://i.imgur.com/QnoKC2F.png) 

- Create the name of this Box recommended name `ISP Ubuntu`
- In Type choose `Linux` if is not auto setected
- In Version choose `Ubuntu (64-bit)`

![Section3](https://i.imgur.com/2JtRAzY.png)

- On the memory section depending to your machine `RAM` capacity the minimun should be `(254MB)` but if you have enough memory use `(1024MB)`

![Section4](https://i.imgur.com/3KinU4J.png)

- Leave the Hard drive section as default which is `(Create a virutal hard disk now)`

![Section5](https://i.imgur.com/OwYGx2s.png)

- Leave the Hard disk file type to `(VDI)` 

![Section5](https://i.imgur.com/XPpGqxm.png)

- Leave storage on physical hard disk to `(Dynamically allocated)` this will used the hard drive memory dinamically until it reach the max you gave it on the next step. 

![Section5](https://i.imgur.com/YGrvBmV.png)

- For this machine the minimun for Ubuntu so it does not give you problem set the File location and `size to (20.00GB)`

![Section5](https://i.imgur.com/p2jIaGn.png)

- After the Virtual Machine is created now you have to add the `ISO` that you download at the beginning 
- Go to Storage section and click on top that it say `[Optical Drive]Empty`

![Section6](https://i.imgur.com/8Rfq6nZ.png)

- Then press `Choose disk image...`

![Section6](https://i.imgur.com/Hbb1y7h.png)

- Find the location where you download your ISO for Ubuntu Server.

- `Right click` the `ISP Ubuntu` and click `settings`

![Section7](https://i.imgur.com/8w6rRfO.png)

- Enable ipv4 routing on Ubuntu. By default Ubuntu doesn't allow for routing on IP traffic.

- This can be done by using nano like so, `sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf`. 
- It will require your `root password` since it effect the entire system when you edit this file.

![Selection9](https://i.imgur.com/LJgDvBJ.png)

- Then press `control+X` to save the config file on ubuntu and enter `Y` to confirm the file and safe the file 

![Selection9](https://i.imgur.com/D2IAI1b.png)

- Then press `Enter` to make sure the file name stay the same

![Selection9](https://i.imgur.com/aWGEO3P.png)

- You should have you loopback `lo` and your network adapters `enp0s3` and `enp0s8` or similars. 

![Selection9](https://i.imgur.com/2r0ghbi.png)

		`iface enp0s8 inet static`
			`address 172.31.11.1`
			`netmask 255.255.255.248`
			`up route add -net 172.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw 172.31.1.2`

![Selection9](https://i.imgur.com/cU2izxY.png)
